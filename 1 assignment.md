NYC  FOODIVERSE
why you chose it?
I have 3 reasons to choose this Website. Firstly, the website appearance is attractive, it makes users want to explore more after first sight. Secondly, the interaction of the website is stunning, powerful and playful. Lastly, even thought the quantity of data in this website is huge, and the content of data is comprehensive and complex, but the designer still suceessfully visualized the map which is understandable for users.


what it is about?
NYC foodiverse is a data visualization experiment about inspection data and foursquare ratings for restaurants in nyc.

how the interactive/online medium chosen was particularly conducive to the narrative?
No, it wasn’t. Beacuase the web is just for showing a aquantity data of NY restaurants. 


Explain how it was built, do some research to define what programming language it was written in; what was its creation story?
This website was built from Html, CSS and Javascript. Its code dependencies are Node.js, Mapbox. Meanwhile, this website’s data resource from NYC open data and Foursquare.

The story behind this website: 
Since New Yorkers consider NYC as “center of the universe”, so I merged food and universe as FOODIVERSE, combined several ddata sources including restaurant inspection data, Foursquare data, and other data source that given by Urban Ecology Lab, the designer manages to blend all the aspect about the restaurants at Manhattan in this visualization, showed different aspect in various ways.
